Article Summarized Front End

Template for Article Bits

Article bits was built using Python NLTK module. It summarizes articles from over 20 new sources based on the TF-IDF ideology. Sentences were ranked based off important term frequency which was then used to build a summary. Important terms were then searched using the Wikipedia module to return a small summary for unfamiliar important terms. Articles were also grouped together so that relationships in the database were created to find similar articles from the 20 sources.

Front end template was a template since it was really nice, but modified for personal use. Also working with D3 charts and graphs.
